# This is the DNS resolver that will be used to resolve all domain names accessed by the bot.
# DNS-over-HTTPS will be used by default on all requests. If you prefer, change it below:
# Example: DoH='https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query'
DoH='https://doh.dnswarden.com:443/uncensored'
# Remember to use independent DNS services that do not collect/store information about domain queries and/or user IPs.
# To see a list of privacy-friendly DNS resolvers, take a look at http://privacytools.io/providers/dns.

# Will all bot traffic go through the Tor network? If yes, set the variable below to "true"

# If you decide to use the Tor network, DNS-over-HTTPS will be automatically disabled.

DisableIPv6='true'

# Do you want Unalix to generate a random user agent before each request? If yes, set the variable below to "true".
# Note that user agent generation can increase bot response time by about 1 to 3 seconds, as it will always be necessary to generate a new user agent for each request.
# If the variable below is set to "false", Unalix will use a predefined user agent for each request.
GenerateUserAgents='true'

# This is the timeout (in seconds) of requests. If this limit has been reached and the request has not yet been completed, it will be terminated.

# Will the bot process links simultaneously? If so, set the variable below to "true".
SimultaneouslyOperations='false'
# Note that, depending on the number of links to be processed, background operations can make your machine slow and/or unresponsive.
# If the value is set to "false", the bot will process a single link at a time.
